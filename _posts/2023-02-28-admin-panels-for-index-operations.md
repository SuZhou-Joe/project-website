meta_description: Simplify cluster operations with index management UI enhancements.

excerpt: OpenSearch now offers users a new interface for running common indexing and data stream operations. Users can perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) and mapping for indexes, index templates, and aliases through the UI as well as open, close, reindex, shrink, and split indexes. This is the first step toward establishing an Admin UI, which will serve as a unified administration panel in OpenSearch Dashboards.

Users may find it difficult to manage indexes, aliases and templates on Opensearch Dashboard by using APIs. There are restrictions and relation-binding stuff, like adding aliases to indexes, simulating an index template by its name and so on in the before. And now, we are excited to announce that the cluster operations have been largely simplified with index management UI enhancements on Opensearch Dashboard v2.5.

### 1. Visual editor for index mappings with nested tree editor.

It is more complicated to build a JSON when it comes to index mappings, which has multiple nested layers and properties. To simplify that, A visual editor is provided with nested properties editable capability. Users can add properties by clicking the operation buttons and see what the mappings will be like by switching to JSON editor.

### 2. Simulate index by index name.

It is hard to indicate what the index will be like considering the existing templates. To solve that, we will try to find if the index name matches any template every time users change the index name and merge what users manually input with what the matching template contains. What you see is what the index you get.

### 3. Edit settings by JSON editor and diff mode.

The new index operation UI provides a visual editor and a JSON editor in case the visual editor does not support all the fields. Further more, we provide editor with diff mode so users can see what changes they have made comparing the existing index, ensure no mistake will be made.

### 4. One click to manage aliases on indexes.

It is easy to see what aliases an index contains while hard to see how many indexes an aliases points to by API. The Aliases page give you the result grouping by alias. Moreover, by using API users have to build alias actions to add/remove indexes behind an alias and manually type the indexes, which is easy to raise faults. By using the Admin UI, it will be much easier to attach/detach indexes from an alias and the alias actions will be automatically generated.

### 5. Simplify the flow for the reindex operation.

You can easily choose the source/destination from the dropdown, and we also provide an ad-hoc destination index creation flow that allows you to import settings and mappings directly from the source, making it more convenient.

### 6. Shrink index operation

Shrink index operation is used to shrink an existing index into a new index with fewer primary shards.

When you want to shrink an index, go to the indices pages, select one index, click the `Shrink` action in the actions menu then you will enter the shrink index page. Please notice that only one index can be shrunk at once and data stream indices are not supported to do shrink, so if multiple indices are selected or a data stream backing index is seletecd in the indices pages, the `Shrink` option is disabled. 

![Image: Shrink-action]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/shrink-action.jpg){:.img-fluid }

Before shrinking, please make sure that the index you want to shrink is not in these states:

* the index's health status is red.
* the index has only one primary shard.

If the index is in one of the states above, some error messages will be shown in the shrink index page while the shrink button is disabled.

Shrink index operation has some prerequisites, if the source index does not meet the conditions, some error messages will be shown in the shrink index page.

One condition is that the source index must block write operations, i.e. the `index.blocks.write` setting in the source index is `true`, if the source index is not set to block write operations, then you can click the `Block write operations` button to set the `index.blocks.write` setting to `true`.

![Image: Shrink-block-write]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/shrink-block-write.jpg){:.img-fluid }

The second condition is that the source index must be open, when the source index is closed, the shrink operation will fail, so you can click the `Open` button to open the index, this may take additional time to complete and the index will be in red health status while opening.

![Image: Shrink-open]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/shrink-open.jpg){:.img-fluid }

Another condition is that a copy of every shard in the source index must reside on the same node, you can move a copy of every shard to one node manually or using the shard allocation filter to do so, but it is not required when the cluster has only one data node or the replica count of the source index is equal to the number of data nodes minus 1(in these cases, a copy of every shard in the source index just reside on the same node). So if a copy of every shard in the source index does not reside on the same node, you can update the `index.routing.allocation.require._name` setting of the source index to move shards to one node automatically.

You can update the setting in the source index's detail page:
![Image: Shrink-move-shards]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/shrink-move-shards.jpg){:.img-fluid }

or submit the following request by `Dev Tools`:

```
PUT test-1/_settings
{
"index.routing.allocation.require._name":"node1"
}

```

After all things are ready, fill the input form in the shrink index page, speficy a name, primary shard count and replica count for the new shrunken index, you can also secify new aliases or select existing aliases to attach them to the new shrunken index. 

![Image: Shrink-configure]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/shrink-configure.jpg){:.img-fluid }

All the settings you specified above will also be shown in the json editor contained in the `Advanced settings` part, you can specify more index settings for the new shrunken index in the json editor, for example, set both `index.routing.allocation.require._name` and `index.blocks.write` to `null`, this will clear the allocation requirement and the index write block copied from the source index.

As the settings for the new shrunken index are specified, click the `Shrink` button then the shrink operation will be triggered:

![Image: Shrink-started]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/shrink-started.jpg){:.img-fluid }

you can see a toast showing the shrink operation started successfully, after minutes or even hours, when the shrink operation is completed, a new toast will be shown says that the source index has been successfully shrunken.

### 7. Open and close index operation

You can selecet multiple indices except the backing indices of a data stream to open or close.

If you don't need to read or search some old indices, but you don't want to delete them, then you can use close opeartion to     close these indices which can maintain the data but have a small overhead on the cluster. Another scenario is that when you want to add an new analyzer to an existing index, you must close the index, define the analyzer and then open the index. A closed index is blocked for read and write operations, so you must type the word close to confirm your action:

![Image: Close-index]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/blog-images/2023-02-28-admin-panels-for-index-operations/close-index.jpg){:.img-fluid }

Open index is easier, you can select multiple indices to open even though these indices are all open:

# In the end

**Try it**

To try the new index management, please find features on [official playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/opensearch_index_management_dashboards#/indices).

## Next steps

Weâ€™ll be releasing more admin UI on features related to data streams, monitor metrics and so on. If you have any great advice on what we have or will release, please leave you message on the [OpenSearch forum](https://forum.opensearch.org/).
